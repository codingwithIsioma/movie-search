Learning how to fetch apis

Created a simple movie search application that lets user input a keyword or movie title, which returns a list of similar movies of that title. It also returns a brief overview of the movie, it's official poster and release date. For making this site I use the TMDB API to fetch the aforementioned data. All copyrights are given to the directors and producers of the movies, as I do not own any of these movies.
